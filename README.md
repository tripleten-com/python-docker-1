## Creating a repository
1. Create a repository for yourself, using this template. 
  To do this, it is necessary to press the "Use this template" button and select the "Create a new repository" option.

## How to work with a repository
To start the task, you need to copy the URL of your repository and clone it (please note that you are cloning your own repository, not the original template!).

### Create a virtual environment

1. Launch the Visual Studio Code editor and through the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù / ‚ÄúOpen Directory‚Äù menu open the *Dev/python-docker-1/* folder.
2. Launch a terminal in VS Code, make sure you're running from the */python-docker-1/* directory (if you're on Windows, make sure you're running Git Bash in the terminal and not PowerShell or anything else), and run the command
- Linux/macOS
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    
- Windows
    
    ```python
    python -m venv venv
    ```
   
A virtual environment will be deployed in the python-docker-1/ directory and a venv folder will appear in which all project dependencies will be stored. The file structure will be like this:

```
Dev/
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ python-docker-1/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/ Workshop tests that check the project
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/ Virtual environment directory
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple_project/ <-- Project directory
     | ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...    <-- Django project structure
     |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py      
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore     List of files and folders hidden from Git tracking (hidden) 
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE     License   
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pytest.ini      Workshop test configuration
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       Description of the project 
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      List of project dependencies
```

### Activation of the virtual environment
In the terminal, go to the root directory of the project (Dev/python-docker-1/) and run this command:
- Linux/macOS
    
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
- Windows
    
    ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
    

Now all commands in the terminal will be preceded by the line `(venv)`.

üí° All further commands in the terminal should be executed with the virtual environment activated.

Refresh pip:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installing dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
While in the Dev/python-docker-1/ folder, run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### End of Support for dependencies

LTS versions of dependencies have been chosen.
For Django, version 3.2 is selected, [extended support](https://endoflife.date/django) of which ends on April 1, 2024.


### Launching the project in dev mode

    
In the directory with the "manage.py" file, run this command: 

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

In response, Django will report that the server is running and the project is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).


### Run tests locally
Having finished the task, launch the local tests. In the terminal, go to the root directory of the project *Dev/python-docker-1/* and run this command:
```shell
pytest
```
If all the test cases are successful, the project will be considered completed. Otherwise, you will have to fix the parts that haven't passed the tests and launch them once again.
